**Verse 1: Database Fundamentals**  
In the world of data, where knowledge resides,  
A database is where it all abides.  
With structure and rules, we start to see,  
How data flows in harmony.  
Tables and rows, the building blocks,  
In the database, everything unlocks.

**Chorus: The Digital Blueprint**  
Data structures, so profound,  
In every byte, our future’s found.  
From models to queries, we design,  
The digital blueprint, by our minds.

**Verse 2: Relational Databases**  
Relations defined, keys set in place,  
In tuples and attributes, we find our space.  
Normalization, to keep it clean,  
No redundancy, that’s our dream.  
Join the tables, let the data merge,  
In every query, the truth we urge.

**Chorus: The Digital Blueprint**  
Data structures, so profound,  
In every byte, our future’s found.  
From models to queries, we design,  
The digital blueprint, by our minds.

**Verse 3: SQL Language**  
With SQL, we speak the code,  
In every query, the data flows.  
Create, select, update, and more,  
We shape the data, it’s never a chore.  
Indexes guide, views show the way,  
In SQL, the data’s here to stay.

**Chorus: The Digital Blueprint**  
Data structures, so profound,  
In every byte, our future’s found.  
From models to queries, we design,  
The digital blueprint, by our minds.

**Verse 4: Database Design**  
From ER models to schema design,  
We map the data, each piece aligned.  
Normalization, our guiding star,  
We structure the data, near and far.  
Security tight, permissions set,  
In database design, no regrets.

**Chorus: The Digital Blueprint**  
Data structures, so profound,  
In every byte, our future’s found.  
From models to queries, we design,  
The digital blueprint, by our minds.

**Outro: The Architecture of Thought**  
In databases, we find our way,  
Through structured paths, where data stays.  
From fundamentals to design,  
In every record, we define.
