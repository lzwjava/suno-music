### **Song 2: "Beyond the Horizon: Advanced Databases"**

#### **Chapters 5 to 7:**
**Lyrics:**

**Verse 1: Database Management Systems**  
In the heart of data, the DBMS reigns,  
Managing the flow, controlling the gains.  
Transactions strong, ACID to hold,  
In every operation, the data’s controlled.  
Index and query, optimized and fast,  
In the DBMS, the future’s cast.

**Chorus: Beyond the Horizon**  
Beyond the basics, where data flies,  
In the systems deep, the truth lies.  
From management to code, we see,  
A world of data, flowing free.

**Verse 2: Distributed Databases and NoSQL**  
Across the network, data spreads wide,  
In shards and nodes, it starts to glide.  
NoSQL rising, in fields unknown,  
Where structured rules are overthrown.  
Distributed power, data shared,  
In every byte, the load is bared.

**Chorus: Beyond the Horizon**  
Beyond the basics, where data flies,  
In the systems deep, the truth lies.  
From management to code, we see,  
A world of data, flowing free.

**Verse 3: Database Application Development**  
In code and scripts, the data moves,  
In every function, the system proves.  
Stored procedures, triggers in play,  
Guiding data, every day.  
Web and database, integrated tight,  
In every app, data takes flight.

**Chorus: Beyond the Horizon**  
Beyond the basics, where data flies,  
In the systems deep, the truth lies.  
From management to code, we see,  
A world of data, flowing free.

**Outro: The Future’s Code**  
In every system, the data’s there,  
Managed, distributed, with utmost care.  
From databases to apps we code,  
In the digital world, our knowledge grows.
